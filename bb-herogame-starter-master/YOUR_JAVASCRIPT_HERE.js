// Write your JS here
//Hero Object
const hero = {
    name: '',
    heroic: true,
    inventory: [],
    health: 10,
    weapon: {
        type: '',
        damage: 2,}

//Game logic functions
//hero.health = 5
function rest(params) {
    const hero = {health: 10};

    }
};
function pickUpItem(params) { 
    
};
function equipWeapon(params) {
    
};

rest(hero.health);

/* Ok so the result he is 10, i don't think I understand the question?!
the point it to call the function with the object 'health' isn't? and it so be assinged the value 10
first changed into 5 and then changed in the function, but when i do so the answer from hero object is incorrect
*/

//at this point I don't know what you expect. The alert goes of with the number 10 from the prperty health.

//there is not image with the id of 'inn', or should I be adding it to the HTML?!
const img = document.getElementById('inn');
const inn = img.setAttributeId;

document.getElementById('inn').click(hero.health = 10);

pickUpItem(hero.weapon)()
const weapon=[]

document.getElementById('dagger');



//Weapon
document.getElementById('bag');





/*I don't seem to know what I am doing, although I think I have the terminology some sort in my head 
and so going to build my own game see if that works.*/
